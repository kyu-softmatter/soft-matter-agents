"""Fixtures for the checks that read git history (11-7).

`--expect-fail contracts/examples/rejected` proves a check still works by
handing it a card that must be refused. Four checks cannot be reached that
way, because what they read is not a file in a folder but **history** --
26 (an envelope snapshot against the export it names), 35 (a commit's paths
against one boundary), 41 (a commit's paths against its committer's seat),
46 (a vocabulary pin resolving in the commit it names). Until now their only
evidence was a sentence in a commit message, and a check nobody has ever seen
fail is a check nobody has tested.

**The repositories are built, not stored.** 11-7 settled the shape on
2026-09-20: keeping four repositories as fixtures is expensive, and `git init`
plus a handful of commits costs seconds. What is expensive is storage, not
creation -- and if a fixture is expensive the cost of adding one becomes the
cost of adding a check, so checks stop growing.

Each fixture copies `contracts/` into a temporary repository and runs **that**
copy of the validator there, so both the file side and the git side see the
fixture and nothing reaches back into the real tree. It is a directory copy of
about a megabyte and it is why this stays cheap.

Like a group fixture, each one **names the check it is for and the verdict it
expects**, and counting requires that verdict *from that check*. Without the
name a fixture passes on an unrelated failure and stays green after the defect
it was built for is gone, which is the state this whole folder exists to
prevent. Unrelated findings are tolerated for the same reason a group folder
tolerates them: the named check is what is counted.

Not every expectation is a refusal. `seats.json` sets `unknown_committer` to
`report`, so an unregistered committer is deliberately **not** refused -- a
seat that has not adopted an identity is not blocked. What that costs is
written in the registry: an unattributed commit gets no boundary checking at
all, because nothing says whose paths those were. The report is the only thing
between that and silence, so it is worth a fixture, and the fixture asserts a
PENDING rather than pretending the rule is stricter than it is.

    python3 contracts/history_fixtures.py

Every fixture must still fire, with the verdict it names. One that stops
firing means a check stopped working.

Two of the four are covered so far, 35 and 41. Checks 26 and 46 need a
built history too and are not here yet; that is a gap in the fixtures, not
in the checks.
